  "Financial statement extraction with normalization and standardization.

   Four output views for each statement (:view option):
     :as-reported   - raw XBRL observations for the statement's concepts,
                      exactly as filed; no deduplication, no label mapping
     :normalized    - (default) fallback chains map variant tags to canonical
                      labels; restatements deduplicated by most-recent-filed
     :standardized  - :normalized plus derived line items imputed from
                      arithmetic identities (e.g. Gross Profit = Revenue -
                      Cost of Revenue). Derived rows carry :method :derived
                      and :derived-from for auditability.
     :compustat     - :standardized plus line items reclassified to
                      approximate Compustat definitions (D&A out of COGS,
                      R&D folded into XSGA, special items added back to
                      operating income, ...). Reclassified rows carry
                      :method :reclassified, :rule and :derived-from.
                      Rules live in resources/edgar/reclass/ (edgar.reclass);
                      income statement and balance sheet (cash flow equals
                      :standardized). With the FSDS cache enabled
                      (edgar.fsds/enable-cache!), 10-K income periods gain
                      statement-placement guards and extension-tag operands.

   Concept fallback chains: each line item is a vector of concept names tried
   in order; the first one present in the facts data wins. Chains are loaded
   from EDN files under resources/edgar/concepts/ and exposed as public vars,
   so power users can inspect them or pass their own via :concepts.

   Industry routing: banks (SIC 6000-6199, 6712) and insurers (SIC 6300-6399,
   6411) use fundamentally different income statement line items. When no
   explicit :industry or :concepts is given, income-statement auto-routes on
   the company's SIC code. Pass :industry :standard to force generic chains.

   Duration vs instant:
     Income statement + cash flow -> duration observations (row has :start date)
     Balance sheet               -> instant observations  (row has no :start date)

   Point-in-time / look-ahead-safe mode:
     Pass :as-of \"YYYY-MM-DD\" to any public function to restrict to filings
     where :filed <= as-of-date.  Without :as-of the latest restated value is
     returned (always-latest behaviour).

   Quarterly and LTM derivation (10-Q only, flow variables only):
     :duration-months - 3/6/9/12 classification of the observation window
     :val-q   - single-quarter value. Derived from actual period dates:
                a ~3-month row is used as-is; a YTD row minus the YTD row one
                quarter shorter (same fiscal-year start) yields the quarter
                ending at the longer row's end. The SEC :fy/:fp fields are
                deliberately NOT used — they describe the filing, not the
                observation, and collide across comparative periods.
     :val-ltm - last-twelve-months: sum of four consecutive derived quarters
                matched on period-end dates (±14 days tolerance for 52/53-week
                fiscal calendars). 10-K annual rows participate in the
                derivation so that Q4 = FY - 9M YTD.

   Unmapped-concept logging: every statement call records us-gaap concepts in
   the company's facts that no active chain matched. See unmapped-concepts,
   clear-unmapped-concepts!, save-unmapped-concepts!."
