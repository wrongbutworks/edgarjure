  "Validation study: edgarjure standardized statements vs Compustat (roadmap 4.1f).

   Reproduces the July 2026 study that graded edgarjure against WRDS Compustat
   extracts for 19 large filers (13 industrials/tech, 3 banks, 3 insurers).

   Headline results:
     Annual core items, FY2010-2015, vs FUNDA (2016 vintage, :as-of matched):
       overall 89.4% (1193/1334 within 1%; two rows moved when the incl-NCI equity tag was relabeled Total Equity); Total Assets 97.7%, Net Income
       96.2%, Stockholders Equity 94.7%, OCF 93.2%; banks' constructed gross
       revenue (Interest Income + Noninterest Income, a derived line item)
       95.2%. Weakest: insurers' Total Revenue 66.7% (Compustat excludes
       realized investment gains) and Pre-Tax Income 78.8% (equity-method
       income placement).
     Quarterly, 2022+ vs FUNDQ: single-quarter income values (:val-q vs
       SALEQ/NIQ) 98.6% (205/208); quarterly Total Assets 100% (104/104).
     Reclassification-sensitive items (COGS, SG&A, R&D, Operating Income,
       Gross Profit vs REVT-COGS) match only ~15-18% as reported — the
       documented Compustat reclassification gap (D&A stripped out of
       COGS/SG&A, etc.). The :view :compustat rule engine (roadmap 4.1c,
       shipped 2026-07) closes much of it: COGS 57%, XSGA 45%, OIADP 38%,
       Gross Profit vs REVT-COGS 58% — see annual-compustat-items and
       validate-reclass below.
     Out-of-sample check (2026-07-28, FY2016+ vs a current-vintage WRDS
       FUNDA extract, ~190 firm-years the rules were never fitted on):
       COGS 54% (as-reported 1%), XSGA 43% (16%), OIADP 34% (19%), OIBDP
       33%, DP 76%. Same firm-level structure as in-sample: near-perfect on
       clean filers (MSFT, PEP, WMT, KO 90-100%), misses concentrated in
       the documented problem cases (CVX, GE, HON, IBM). The out-of-sample
       pass produced the :dp-components rule (Depreciation + intangible
       amortization beats the combined cash-flow D&A tag whose scope can
       exceed Compustat DP - AMZN's includes content amortization); AMZN's
       Compustat XSGA/XRD need its Fulfillment and Technology & Content
       extension tags, which the companyfacts API does not carry (FSDS
       territory).
     Extended items (annual): Investing/Financing Cash Flow 96.2%, Goodwill
       95.2%, Shares Basic/Diluted 89/88%, Cash 87.8%, EPS 79.5%, PP&E 77.6%.
       Known-definitional laggards (documented, not chased):
       - Retained Earnings 16%: Compustat RE carries treasury-stock and other
         adjustments vs the raw RetainedEarningsAccumulatedDeficit tag
       - Accounts Receivable 30%: Compustat RECT is total receivables; the
         XBRL line is trade receivables
       - Long-Term Debt 53%: Compustat DLTT includes finance leases (AMZN's
         early years are almost entirely leases)
       - Interest Expense 29%: XINT aggregates related expense components
       - EPS mismatches are stock-split vintage artifacts (Compustat keeps
         as-reported; restated XBRL is split-adjusted — align with AJEX or
         per-year :as-of) plus discontinued-ops exclusion (EPSPX/EPSFX)
       - D&A 51%: filers tagging depreciation and intangible amortization
         separately are covered by a derived identity; remaining gaps are
         Compustat DP definitional scope
     Balance sheet / cash flow items (third pass):
       clean: Total Liabilities and Equity 98.5%, Total Equity 94.7%
       (derived: SE + NCI, falling back to SE), Working Capital 90%
       (derived-only), Net Change in Cash 89.4%, Income Taxes Payable 88.6%,
       Acquisitions 84.8%, Share Buybacks 78.1%, LT Debt Issued 75.2%,
       Deferred Taxes (CF) 74.5%, LT Debt Repaid 70.7%.
       Known-definitional laggards:
       - Noncontrolling Interest 0%: Compustat MIB includes redeemable/
         mezzanine NCI and subsidiary preferred; us-gaap:MinorityInterest is
         the equity-section NCI only (AIG diverges by 10-30x in both
         directions)
       - Current Debt 44%: Compustat DLC = notes payable + commercial paper
         + current LTD; us-gaap:DebtCurrent is the closest single tag but
         many filers tag only components
       - Short-Term Investments ~40%: Compustat IVST bucket vs heterogeneous
         tags (MarketableSecuritiesCurrent may include equities)
       - Accounts Payable 63%: banks have no AP line; some filers tag only
         the combined payables-and-accruals value
       - Preferred Stock 30%: Compustat PSTK is a broader construction

   Known matching pitfalls this study codified into the harness:
     - Compustat DATADATE is calendar month-end; XBRL :end is the exact
       52/53-week date -> :date-tolerance-days 10
     - 10-K facts include quarterly-footnote rows sharing the FY end date ->
       the harness prefers the longest duration window per date
     - Ticker->CIK gives the CURRENT registrant; validate old fiscal years
       against the historical entity's CIK (Alphabet pre-2015 = Google Inc
       0001288776; similarly for other reorganized issuers)
     - Compustat values are in millions (scale by 1e6); skip nil/zero cells
     - Fiscal Q4 never exists in 10-Q data - exclude Q4 benchmark rows
       (or validate annual figures against the 10-K instead)
